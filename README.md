TRANSITion is a community history project documenting the use of what was until recently the Ford manufacturing site on Wide Lane, Southampton.

The strapline, ‘From fields to Ford and beyond’, is to be included in the logo at all times.

## Included in this repository

The dimensions in the file names refer to the native width of the logo file in each case. All files include a blank area around the visible logo elements, which represents the _minimum_ area to be kept clear of other graphic elements.

### CMYK vector files 

These have _transparent_ backgrounds, may be scaled to any size, and are ideal for importing into or opening in professional graphics applications:

* **transition-logo_200mm_cmyk.eps**: generated in Adobe Illustrator CC2017
* **transition-logo_200mm_cmyk.pdf**: a PDF/X-1a compliant PDF

### RGB raster image files 

Ideal for use in Microsoft Office applications or, more generally, on screen:

* **transition-logo_2000px_rgb.png**: do not reproduce in print larger than 170mm wide
* **transition-logo_1000px_rgb.png**: half the resolution and one third the file size of the 2000 pixels wide version, do not reproduce in print larger than 85mm wide

The PNG files above have _transparent_ backgrounds and are strongly preferred to JPEG as a logo image file format, but sometimes people insist on a JPEG. For this reason, also provided is:

* **transition-logo_2000px_rgb.jpg**: opaque _white_ background, do not reproduce in print larger than 170mm wide
